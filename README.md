# Setting Up Your EC2 Machine

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub account to your EC2 machine.

## I - Connecting to your machine : 

### **1. Connect to your EC2 Machine**
On your CLI, move to the directory where you put the `K-Internship-2025.pem`.

  - Set the right permissions to the key file so it can me used to your connection with the EC2 instance : 
    ```bash 
    chmod 400 /path/to/your-key.pem
    ```


  - Connect to your instance: 
    ```bash
    ssh -i K-Internship-2025.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip
    ````

  - Launch `code-server`:
    ```bash
    code-server
    ```
Now you can access your Web IDE from your browser by going to: `your-instance-public-ip:8090`

## II - Setting up your Github account and getting your Tests Day repository: 

### **1. Configure Git**
Set your global Git configuration with your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

Generate a new SSH key pair for authentication:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- Save the key to the default location (e.g., `/home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- Optionally, set a passphrase or leave it blank.


### **2. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**
Start the SSH agent and add your new key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```


### **3. Add Your SSH Key to GitHub**
1. Display the public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
2. Copy the output of the above command.
3. Go to your GitHub account; on your local machine:
   - Navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG Keys**.
   - Click **New SSH Key**.
   - Paste the key and give it a title (e.g., "EC2 Machine").
   - Click **Add SSH Key**.


### **4. Test the SSH Connection**
Verify that your EC2 instance is successfully connected to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like this:

```plaintext
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```


### **5. Clone Repositories or Push Changes**
You are now ready to clone repositories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:keiken-digital-solution/K-Internship-2025.git
```

# Deliverables

1. Create a new branch with the name `KI2025/yourfullname`.
2. For each exercise, read the README.md file, follow the steps to complete the exercise, and save your work.
3. Commit your work and push it to on the branch you created.
